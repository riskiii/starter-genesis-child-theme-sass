# Starter Genesis Child Theme with Gulp & Sass

Note: as this theme's stylesheet is generated from Sass, changes made directly to style.css will be overwritten when the Sass partials are compiled again.

## Installation:
From the theme's root directory, run the command `npm install` to download the theme's dependencies.
